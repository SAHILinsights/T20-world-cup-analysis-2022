I Recently analyzed the T20 World Cup 2022 using Python + Pandas and visualized everything in Power BI.

I have taken certain Parameters for Analysis of Players Performances
(OPENERS,ANCHORS,MIDDLE-ORDERS,ALL-ROUNDERS,BOWLERS)
Such as Batting average , strike rate , Balls faced , etc. which helped me to learn many statistical insights 

From cleaning messy cricket data to discovering patterns like top performers, match-winning factors, and bowling impact — this project helped me improve both my technical and analytical thinking.
